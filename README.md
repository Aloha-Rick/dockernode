# Synereo Dockerfiles

Dockerfiles for easily setting up a Synereo node.

## Prerequisites

Install and be familiar with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/). On OS X or Windows you'll probably want to use [Kitematic](https://docs.docker.com/kitematic/). On Linuxes with modern kernels, such as Arch Linux, you can just use plain [Docker](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Docker).
